  # Logical Operators Practice #1
  # Create three variables (num1, num2, and num3):
  num1 = 36
  num2 = 72/2
  num3 = 48
  # Inside num1, store the value 36
  
  # Inside num2, stores the result of the operation 72/2
  
  # Inside num3, store the value 48
  
  # Check if num1 is greater than num2, and less than num3. Store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
  my_bool = num1 > num2 < num3
  print(my_bool)
    
  #   Logical Operators Practice #2
  # Check if the words:
  
  word1 = "success"
  
  word2 = "technology"
  
  # are not found in the sentence below, and store the result (a boolean) in a variable called my_bool:
  my_bool = "success" not in "technology"
  print(my_bool)
